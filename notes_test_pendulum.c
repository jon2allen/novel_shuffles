Here's a complete program with a test harness for the `pendulum_shuffle` function:



This program includes the following:

1.  The `pendulum_shuffle` function, which implements the pendulum shuffle algorithm.
2.  A `print_array` function to print the elements of an array.
3.  A test harness in the `main` function, which tests the `pendulum_shuffle` function with arrays of different sizes.
4.  The `srand` function is used to seed the random number generator, ensuring that the shuffle is truly random.

You can modify the `test_cases` array to test the function with different array sizes. The program will print the original and shuffled arrays for each test case.
